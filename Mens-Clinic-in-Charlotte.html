Hypogonadism can be treated with doctor-prescribed testosterone replacement therapy. This safe, and effective treatment has been a viable alternative for men experiencing some of the symptoms of low testosterone, as well as those associated with androgen and other hormone deficiencies. While testosterone replacement therapy remains a primary treatment option, there are some scenarios where hypogonadism can be reversed with other alternatives. Because the goal of the treatment is to increase the likelihood of positive outcomes due to the symptoms associated with the condition, it is always best to discuss your desired outcomes with a physician to find out exactly the type of testosterone replacement therapy in Charlotte that is right for you.A Few Facts About Testosterone in MenTestosterone levels naturally lower in men as they age. In healthy men, there's a decrease in testosterone levels of about 1% per year after the age of 30. A few of the physiological areas that lead to disruption in natural testosterone production include the brain, testicles, and pituitary gland. Contrary to popular belief, testosterone levels are dynamic throughout the day, tending to peak in the morning and tail off at night. In addition to genetics, habits can lead to significantly lower or higher levels of testosterone production, including too little or too much exercise, certain illnesses, certain medications, and poor nutrition to name a few. In a normal condition, the common range of free testosterone levels is around 300-1,000 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL).If you experience any of these symptoms, you may want to talk to a doctor about male hypogonadism:A noticeable drop in libidoA lower than normal sperm countReduced energy, increase fatigue, or a noticeable reduction in muscle massA noticeable increase in fat percentageDecreased ability to concentrate, increased frequency of depression or irritabilityBreast enlargement, tenderness or sensitivitySome Methods of Testosterone Replacement Therapy in CharlotteThe root cause of your low testosterone will help determine the method in which your testosterone replacement therapy treatment is given.Injections are one of the most common methods of delivery, administered into a large area of muscle about every week or two.There are also an assortment of gels that can be applied to the armpit, shoulder, or arm region, depending on your comfort level with topical solutions.Patches are also an option, where by adhesive patches of testosterone that administer doses throughout the day are attached to your skin around areas of your abdomen, arm, thigh, or back.Tablets are yet another option that are placed next to the gums once or twice a day. This method quickly gets integrated into the bloodstream, but can lead to gum irritation in some patients.Nasal gels can be applied with a pump into the nostrils multiple times a day if the patient does not suffer from any congestion or irritable nasal passages.Pellets can be implanted surgically under the skin for long term testosterone dosages. One side effect of this method includes doses that tend to decrease over time.As with all medical treatments, there are certain conditions that will want to avoid testosterone treatment, which makes it very important to discuss your options with a trusted physician who has experience administering testosterone replacement therapy in Charlotte. In particular, men who have enlarged prostates should have screening before starting this therapy. Those who have high PSA screenings, or a higher than normal number of red blood cells, sleep apnea, or any history of congestive heart failure, should certainly discuss these issues with their doctor before any treatment is administered.<br><br><center><iframe
